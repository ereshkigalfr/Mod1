			"eightQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "This is a crucial moment for the Specialist's research: what you do now will decide everything, in both the short-term, and the long-term. Will you be able to save the Laboratory?",
			"eightQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "Hell! That's perfect! You saved the Laboratory equipment and the research! Bought me the time I need to look into their servers and finish off what I can. Come see me later, dodger- I've still got some work for you.",
			"eightQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "Alright, this is getting bad- they've caught onto us. They're planning on sending mercs to stop us in our tracks by having them go scorched earth on the Laboratory- documents, servers, the whole nine yards. You've got to go in there and make sure they don't get the chance. Get moving, dodger!",
			"eleventhQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "You’ve managed to prevent the mercenaries from recovering and destroying TerraGroup intel and equipment so you won’t be hearing about them for a while. They’re going to have to prepare, but so are you. Give yourself a breather, and prepare for the worst. You’re going to have to reenergize yourself for the upcoming fights. You’re ready? That’s good. Now, the folks at TerraGroup have been preparing very specific stocks... ",
			"eleventhQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "Well done boy, this will prevent them from finding the crates and utilizing them! It might save us some trouble down the line. Now, I still have a job for you, so come see me whenever you have the time! ",
			"eleventhQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "So my boy, I managed to get some information about stocks of experimental drugs hidden in a cache at the mall. Apparently, they were planning to test the drugs on the local population. Intel states that it’s located in some sort of armory, with some MS2000 Markers in the crates so they can be transported. I need you to find out where the crates are located, remove the markers, and report back to me! ",
			"fifthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "It's starting to get interesting. New syringes have started to crop up containing unknown stimulants, with positive effects that seem promising. It might be enough for TerraGroup to stay afloat- maybe there'll be a time where they'll have more weaponry prototypes, too?",
			"fifthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "Thanks for finding me these weapon parts, dodger. Go ahead and assemble the rifle and hand it over- I'll modify it according to plan. In the meantime, there are some files from TerraGroups to... pan over.",
			"fifthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "Good work, dodger- listen to me, carefully. I need you to bring me a particular weapon- a Colt M4A1 with a 20inch barrel, a Colt buffer tube and a Colt charging handle, a High Standard M4SS Stock, a tan PMAG M3 30 FDE magazine, a colt A2 pistol grip, a URX 3.1 10,75inch handguard, a low-profile MK12 gas block, and that it all comes from the Laboratory. It'd be great if all of it came from there- then I'd be certain it's all compatible with what I want to do. Get moving, buddy!",
			"firstQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "I heard that some encrypted data from TerraGroup had been stolen by a certain someone hiding out with his buddies in the old Federal State Reserve Agency base. I bet there's some good information on it that could be sold for the right price, but... I won't bore you with the details. Get to work, killer.",
			"firstQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "I was able to decrypt part of that encrypted data you found on Gluhar. It mentions a former USEC operator working under TerraGroup who's looking for a reliable pair of hands. Considering you're confident, you should take a look at it- apparently, his hideout isn't far from the entrance of some hidden-away laboratory. He might have some valuable equipment lying around.",
			"firstQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "Alright, listen up, killer. Gluhar and his lackeys are well-armed and well-prepared- and they're expecting trouble. They're over in the old Federal State Reserve Agency base, and tend to patrol around the barracks. You need to put them down and find an encrypted drive on one of them. Kill them, and bring me that damn encrypted drive!",
			"fourthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "You thought you'd get out of there unscathed? Well, you can dream, but... it seems like he wants to send you to the grave with this one. Don't believe that it's without risk- everything you do, touch, or breathe on this job will have an impact on your body. Take care, and above all else, take... adequate precautions.",
			"fourthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "Whoa! I didn't believe for a second that you'd make it there, let alone make it back. You wore the mask from start to finish, didn't you? Hand it over, so I can get it properly contained and start taking a look at it- and come see me, when you have time. I've still got work for you.",
			"fourthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "Perfect, you're back! See, those eggheads down in TerraGroup's laboratories were working on some sort of new material. Their database is too large and too well-protected for me to learn anything about it in the short term, so... you've got some leg-work to do. Find yourself a gas mask, and get moving. Don't take the mask off until the stuff's left your hands.",
			"ninthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "Expect the unexpected. It's time to take one small leap into the secrets of TerraGroup- there's still a lot to discover, at all. Don't hesitate, and prepare yourself to undergo significant pressure, exertion and stress. Your life and livelihood is at stake.",
			"ninthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "Ready, dodger? Perfect, because that's the end of your fun. I've prepared something for you- try to make good use of it?",
			"ninthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "Hey, dodger. Finished something for you- go ahead and take it. I don't have a job for you yet, so take advantage of your new-found freetime and prepare yourself. I've made some interesting discoveries, so come back soon and I might be able to tell you what to do.",
			"secondQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "Despite how hard it was to decrypt the data, Fence's contacts made short work of it. Thanks to them, you've gotten into contact with that ex-USEC operator- but, now he wants you to prove your worth to him. You're going to need to get your hands dirty.",
			"secondQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "There you are again! I'm surprised you pulled that off- at least you don't seem like you'll get yourself killed by a bunch of flies. I still need you, so hold on a second: this is important. I have a few more... missions, if you'll take them: and don't worry, I have a good reward in mind.",
			"secondQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "So, dodger, it was you who managed to decrypt my drive? Interesting! You look like too much of a bruiser to have pulled that off without some help- so, you're going to show me that you've got some wits. You know what's hidden away not too far from here- so, you're going to go in there, and fight your way out. Three times. Get the lead out, we don't have all day!",
			"seventhQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "Now that you've got your hands on your new rifle, you need to find a way to obtain its ammunition. If it was tested in-house by TerraGroup, then maybe there's some in the Laboratory? The Specialist seems to believe it.",
			"seventhQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "Whoa! You really found them? Well played! Knew I could count on you- so, listen: I'm going to give you a few for the moment, but not much. Come back later, and I should be able to make more.",
			"seventhQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "Listen, if you want me to make rounds for your new toy, you're going to have to do some legwork. Go down into the Laboratory and find the rounds they were using with the prototype rifle. I don't know where they were stored, so I can't really tell you much more- but try to be logical in your searching, alright?",
			"sixthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "Finally, things are getting serious. The Specialist is putting the finishing touches on a prototype AR-pattern rifle that was meant to be manufactured by TerraGroup and tested in this self-same Laboratory, but... you still lack the most important part: ammunition. Try not to misplace the rifle, would you?",
			"sixthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "And... here! The job's done. I've reassembled the prototype- an M4A1 converted to 6.5x39mm Grendel in-house, but... we don't have the ammunition. Try not to lose it! I don't have what it takes to assemble another right now.",
			"sixthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "Pass the rifle over, and I can sort out the conversion.",
			"tenthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "You thought you were quiet the last time you prevented the TerraGroup raid on the Lab. Turns out, you’re wrong. This is only the beginning of a bitter struggle to keep you from getting your hands on confidential Lab intel, and you angered them. ",
			"tenthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_failed": "Great, they managed to seize some of the equipment and you didn’t stop them. We just lost some valuable information and assets from TerraGroup that we could have utilized. You’re a damn bother to me! ",
			"tenthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "Well done boy, you’ve done a good job again. Here, I managed to get my hands on some prototype armor the scientists were working on while I was still employed under TerraGroup. Take good care of it, it’s the only one I have in stock... ",
			"tenthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "Hey boy! Listen here, we have a problem on our hands. I just saw a large group of mercenaries enter the Lab. I think they’re back once again to either destroy TerraGroup property or take it for themselves to prevent us from getting our hands on it. Appropriate. Here, take this gear and go defend the Lab. Kill all the mercenaries there before they can leave with any goods, and hurry the hell up! Ah, wait a minute… there’s word that they’re also planning to test some sort of dangerous new gas, so better you be wearing a gas mask as a precaution, lest you end up dead from the gas. ",
			"thirdQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "You've proven your worth to him, but this is only the beginning. It's time to give it your all- did you really think that TerraGroups abandoned their lab outright? Well... you're wrong.",
			"thirdQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "Congratulations! Those jammers were doing some nasty work, but thanks to your efforts, I've got the wiggle-room I needed to get into and around TerraGroup's systems. Together, we can make a hell of a profit- and I'll be able to prepare for you some stuff that was intended for some of their Special Forces contractors. They should allow you to get a leg up on others looking to unearth the secrets of TerraGroup.",
			"thirdQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "So, buddy, you're back- ready for a mission? Perfect. It turns out that I could get external access to TerraGroup's servers, but those spooks managed to lock them down tight with jammers. You're going to go in there and get rid of them- so bring a good kit with you and pack a lunch: you're gonna' need it. I should be able to use those jammers for other things, if you bring them back, to get started.",
			"twelfthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_description": "It's time to put your talents to the test. Will you be able to repel them and survive? Or will you succumb and suffer the consequences?",
			"twelfthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_failedMail": "...",
			"twelfthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_mail": "Good, you made it through. Nice gun you picked up, they're well-equipped.",
			"twelfthQuest_terragroupSpecialist_StartedMail": "Now listen to me. Mercenaries have been shot by scavs in the woods. There must be equipment left where they died, find them and retrieve that equipment. Be careful, Terragroup soldiers are most likely looking for them, so be careful, they're not kidding. Don't hesitate to use the weapon you might find!"

Now, with the Bad News Gen. II, we’ve taken a rifle that was already a long-distance powerhouse, and completely upgraded it.

It was developed during the 1980s as a high-powered, long-range cartridge for military snipers. It was used in the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War. As a result of this, it became more widely available. In addition to its military role, it is increasingly used by hunters and civilian long-range shooting enthusiasts. The .338 Lapua Magnum is capable of taking down any game animal, though its suitability for some dangerous game (Cape buffalo, hippopotamus, white rhinoceros, and elephant) is arguable, unless accompanied by a larger \"backup\" calibre: \"There is a huge difference between calibres that will kill an elephant and those that can be relied upon to stop one.\""
