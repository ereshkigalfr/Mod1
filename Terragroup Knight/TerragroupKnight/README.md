# Welcome to the Terragroup Knight mod readme.

## What do the mod ?
This mod features a new trader with his own story related to tarkov. With the trader comes up a bunch of new quests, with new mechanics related to those quests.</br>
The mod also introduce new bots to the game with their own equipment and clothing and (only one for now) new boss on one of the tarkov map.</br>
Feature a new mechanic across the entire tarkov territory once you start the trader questline.
Be ready, this is gonna be challenging.

The first quest will be available once "Overpopulation" is completed and the player reached level 25 at Skier.
